To achieve simple compatibility of this mod with yours tech sub-mods, you will need to do several actions:
1. Specify in the description.mod in the dependencies section, the name of this mod is "OWB: Tech Tree Rework".
#	dependencies={
#		"Old World Blues"
#		"OWB: Tech Tree Rework"
#	}

2. To match your changes of the main mod with the changes of the current one in folder "common\technologies". 
   Because this mod separates the technological trees so that the other mods do not overwrite each other, this was done to increase the compatibility of mods.

3. If there is a rewrite of the original technology_categories in your tech submod, to add new ones, then I ask you to redo the addition of new categories 
   into a separate file without copying the original categories.
#   technology_categories = {
#			power_armor_tech_category
#   }


If there are new technology_folders in your mod, then you will need to do the following. How is it done in the Power Armor Rework mod:
1. Add a new file to on_actions, in which a global flag will be added at on_startup, which will allow this mod to identify your mod. 
#	on_actions = {
#		on_startup = {
#			effect = {
#				set_global_flag = PowerArmorReworked	
#			}
#		}
#	}

2. Create a separate file in technology_tags with your technology folder, which will have the has_global_flag condition set in the available property.
#	fallout_power_armor_par_folder = {
#		ledger = army
#		available = { 
#			has_global_flag = PowerArmorReworked 
#		}
#	}

3. Contact the mod developers or send the mod to Github, Pull request with your changes "countrytechtreeview.gui", "countrytechtreeviewitems.gui" and technology folder file
